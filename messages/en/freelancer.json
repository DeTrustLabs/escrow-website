Traditional freelancing requires one party to take significant risk - either the freelancer completes work without payment guarantee, or the client pays upfront without delivery assurance.

              "question": "What is digital escrow for freelance projects?",
              "answer": "Digital escrow for freelance projects is a secure peer-to-peer payment method that protects both freelancers and clients during project work. Instead of a third party holding your funds, the escrow uses smart contracts on the blockchain to automatically manage payments based on pre-agreed conditions. Funds remain in the smart contract (Escrow) until project completion and approval conditions are met, eliminating the traditional risks where either the freelancer works first without payment guarantee or the client pays upfront without delivery assurance."
            },
            "q2": {
              "question": "How do I get started with freelance escrow?",
              "answer": "Click the \"Start Escrow\" button to create a wallet or sign-in. For more detailed information about the complete process, see our Workflow page which explains each step from setup to fund release."
            },
            "q3": {
              "question": "What types of freelance work can use escrow?",
              "answer": "Digital escrow can be used for nearly every type of freelance service where deliverables are provided, including web development, graphic design, content writing, digital marketing, photography, consulting, and more. The escrow supports freelancer-to-client (F2C), business-to-freelancer (B2F), and individual-to-freelancer (I2F) transactions. For a comprehensive overview of supported service categories, visit our Supporting All Service Categories section to get a first impression of the possibilities."

            "q1": {
              "question": "How secure are my funds in escrow?",
              "answer": "Funds in the escrow are secure. No third party, including the development company that created the technology behind the escrow, has access to funds in the escrow. The funds are held in what's called a smart contract, which is a self-executing program on the blockchain that automatically enforces the agreed terms without human intervention. The escrow uses a multi-signature approach, meaning multiple cryptographic signatures are required to authorize any transaction, providing an additional layer of security. This ensures that funds can only be released when all predetermined conditions are met by both project parties."
            },
            "q2": {
              "question": "What happens if there's a project dispute?",
              "answer": "Both parties can raise disputes, which immediately freezes the funds to protect everyone involved. Once a dispute is initiated, both parties have time to find a bilateral compromise and agree on adjustments such as offering revisions, extending deadlines, or partial payments. If they cannot reach a compromise through direct negotiation, the case will be escalated to a neutral arbitrator for final resolution. For detailed information about this process, see our Project Dispute Resolution section."

            "q1": {
              "question": "How long does the freelance escrow process take?",
              "answer": "The time depends entirely on your project scope and complexity. It could be just a few days for simple tasks, but also weeks or months for complex development projects. Here's a typical example: Setup (1 day), Funding (1 day), Project work (2-4 weeks), Review (2-3 days), Funds release (same day). For a quicker project: Setup and Funding today, Work completion in 3-5 days, Review and funds release within 24 hours of submission."
            },
            "q2": {
              "question": "When are funds released to the freelancer?",
              "answer": "Fund release depends on the pre-agreed release methods that both parties establish when setting up the escrow. The release method depends on the specific needs and requirements of your project. For detailed information about the various release options available, see our Flexible Payment Release Options section."

              "question": "What are the fees for using freelance escrow?",
              "answer": "The escrow is based on a blockchain solution, which requires transaction fees (often called \"gas fees\" - named after the computational energy needed to process transactions, similar to how a car needs gas to run). These blockchain transaction fees are necessary to secure and process your transactions on the network. There may be additional fees such as review fees for external verification, fees for project advisors, and fees for arbitration services. All fees are completely transparent - when you define the project amount and select optional services during escrow setup, both freelancer and client will see exactly what fees apply. The client funds the project amount plus all fees, and the escrow will not be activated unless the full amount is funded."
            },
            "q2": {
              "question": "What payment methods are accepted?",
              "answer": "You need to distinguish between payment methods for the escrow and payment methods for your wallet. The escrow uses only digital currencies such as USDT (USD from Tether), USDC (USD from Circle), or other stablecoins and CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). The escrow is funded using currencies from your digital wallet. To get USDC, USDT, or other stablecoins into your wallet, you can use cryptocurrency exchanges or On-Ramp providers. For detailed information about converting traditional money to digital currencies, see our Digital Payments for Freelancers section."

              "question": "Which countries and regions are supported for freelance work?",
              "answer": "The escrow is a peer-to-peer system that can theoretically connect freelancers and clients in any country or region of the world. However, it can only be used in countries where digital currencies are legally allowed. Some restrictions may apply based on local regulations and international sanctions lists. We recommend checking your local regulations regarding digital currency usage and checking international regulations and sanctions before proceeding with transactions."
            },
            "q2": {
              "question": "How do you handle project scope and deliverable requirements?",
              "answer": "The escrow is a financial contract that is based on the underlying project agreement or work contract but does not replace these contracts. Freelancers and clients are responsible for clearly defining project scope, deliverables, timelines, revision policies, intellectual property rights, and all other project requirements. Since the escrow operates as a peer-to-peer transaction, compliance with local employment laws and tax obligations remain with the individual parties. We recommend using detailed project contracts and consulting with legal advisors for complex freelance arrangements."
