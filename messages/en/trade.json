					"onboarding": {
						"title": "Onboarding",
						"description": "The secure escrow process begins with a simple online setup completed within minutes. Both importer and exporter create a digital wallet — a secure digital account for sending and receiving digital currencies like USD or EUR. This wallet acts like a digital bank account, keeping everything private. The setup requires no traditional banks and gives you complete control over your assets. Once established, you can easily participate in international trade escrows with full privacy and security.",
						"features": [
							"Sign-In and create a digital wallet",
							"No banks required, full asset control",
							"Ready for international trade participation"
						]
					},
					"escrowAgreement": {
						"title": "Escrow Agreement",
						"description": "To begin, you open a new escrow, invite your trading partner and define together the terms of the escrow like amount, funding date, delivery date, and release mechanism. If you need any support you can also involve a trade advisor, who can prepare the escrow, but has no access to escrow funds. You also choose an arbitration court from the start for any disputes—this court only gets involved if needed and can't see the transaction otherwise. This legal contract (escrow) focuses specifically on payment security and does not replace a buying contract or invoice. Both parties digitally sign the escrow agreement, creating a binding contract that ensures fairness throughout the trade process.",
						"features": [
							"Agree on escrow terms",
							"Trade Advisor to help with setup",
							"Digital signatures create binding contract"
						]
					},
					"verifiedFunding": {
						"title": "Verified Funding",
						"description": "The importer deposits the agreed amount using digital currencies within the specified timeframe. Once deposited, both parties receive immediate confirmation that funds are secured and protected. The escrow holds these funds neutrally until delivery conditions are satisfied, eliminating risks of non-payment for exporters and non-delivery for importers.",

							"Importer deposits funds",
							"Instant funding verification and information",
							"Funds are ready and secure"
						]
					},
					"delivery": {
						"title": "Delivery",
						"description": "Following funding confirmation, the exporter initiates production and shipping. Key documents such as Bills of Lading are uploaded to track progress, while delivery receipts provide proof of arrival.

							"Funding confirmation triggers production and shipping",
							"Upload document as proof of delivery",
							"Verification of proof of delivery"
						]
					},
					"releaseOfFunds": {
						"title": "Release of Funds",
						"description": "Fund release occurs through pre-selected mechanisms including importer confirmation, third-party inspections by companies like SGS or Intertek, customs verification, or electronic document validation.

All documentation and correspondence is encrypted and saved, helping to quickly reconstruct the transaction history. Trading partners have time to resolve issues bilaterally through negotiation, such as offering discounts or extending deadlines. If bilateral resolution fails, the dispute escalates to a pre-defined neutral arbitrator who has access to all transaction data to make informed decisions. This comprehensive evidence system enables efficient dispute resolution based on clear documentation rather than conflicting claims.",

					"title": "What Are Digital Currencies?",
					"description": "A digital currency, also known as a stablecoin, is a digital representation of traditional money (FIAT currency) like the US dollar. A digital USD is pegged 1:1 to the paper USD, reflecting its value while offering the advantages of blockchain technology. Stablecoins are issued by (regulated) institutions and backed by collateral, ensuring their stability and trustworthiness. The largest stablecoins are currently USDT and USDC, which are issued by Tether and Circle. Stablecoins are perfect for cross-border transactions since they settle instantly and are cheap to send, making international trade more efficient and cost-effective."
				},
				"digitalWallet": {
					"title": "What Is a Wallet?",
					"description": "A digital wallet is like a secure digital bank account that you control completely. It's an app on your phone or computer where you can store, send, and receive digital currencies like stablecoins. Think of it as your personal digital safe - only you have the key (password), and no bank or third party can access your funds. For international traders, a wallet provides direct control over payments without needing traditional banks. Once ready, you can participate in secure escrow transactions with trading partners worldwide, keeping your funds private and under your complete control."
				},
				"fiatConversion": {
					"title": "How can I change FIAT into Stablecoins?",
					"description": "You can use an exchange or an on-ramp provider to convert traditional money into digital currencies. Exchanges like Coinbase and Binance are platforms where you can buy, sell, and trade various digital currencies including stablecoins. An On-ramp Provider or Digital Money Converter is a licensed provider that exchanges traditional money (FIAT) for digital currencies like stablecoins, ensuring secure and compliant transactions. For both, you send them FIAT money via bank transaction, mobile payment, or credit card, and they credit your wallet with the equivalent stablecoin. For example, imagine you send 100 USD (FIAT) to them - they exchange it to 100 USDT (stablecoin) in your digital wallet. These providers handle the KYC/KYB (Know Your Customer/Business) verification process to ensure compliance with financial regulations, making the conversion process both secure and legally compliant for international trade."

		"solvesRisks": {
			"title": "How Escrow Solves Risks in International Trade",
			"description": "A digital escrow for cross-border trade eliminates the buyer and seller dilemma that prevents successful international transactions. Traditional trade requires one party to take significant risk - either the exporter ships first and waits for payment, or the importer pays upfront without delivery guarantees. A digital escrow for exporters and importers solves this by securely holding funds until goods are delivered and verified, creating trust between trading partners worldwide and enabling secure global commerce.",

		"trustChanges": {
			"title": "Because Trust Changes Everything",
			"description": "International trade opens exciting opportunities, connecting exporters and importers to new markets and growth potential. Yet, trust is a major challenge with new trading partners, especially across different countries with unfamiliar laws, regulations, and languages. This is even harder when partners have never traded or have only a few deals, leaving no track record to rely on. Fraud cases—deals failing due to unreliable counterparts—make caution critical, often stopping trades before they start."

				"title": "Exporter Risks",
				"description": "Exporters often face the highest risk in global trade. Typically, they deliver goods first and wait for payment, leaving them vulnerable to importers who might refuse to pay or disappear after receiving the goods. Exporters could lose not just the payment but also the costs of production and shipping, which can be devastating for their business."
			},
			"importerRisks": {
				"title": "Importer Risks",
				"description": "Importers worry about non-delivery or poor quality. If they pay upfront, they risk getting nothing in return or receiving items that don't match what was promised.

Everything seemed fine: documents were signed, goods were delivered. But the payment never came—it was a scam. Cash flow dried up fast. I couldn't pay my workers and suppliers. One bad deal pushed my business into bankruptcy. I wish I'd known how quickly one unpaid invoice could destroy everything."

His company in Spain was our biggest client. Then the economic downturn hit Europe hard. Carlos's business struggled and eventually stopped completely. He owed us €280,000 when his company filed for bankruptcy, creating big trouble on our side. We survived, but learned to more diversify our client base because trouble of a client could easily spill over and put our own company at risk."

				"title": "Challenges Exporters Face in Global Trade",

				"nonPaymentRisk": {
					"title": "Non-Payment Risk",
					"description": "Exporters often deliver goods first and wait for payment, leaving them vulnerable to importers who refuse to pay or disappear after receiving the goods. This can result in significant financial losses, including the cost of production and shipping. This common challenge in international trade is exacerbated by geographical distance and limited recourse in foreign jurisdictions. Many exporters have experienced situations where buyers simply vanish after receiving shipments, leaving them with substantial losses and no practical way to recover their funds."
				},
				"liquidityRisk": {
					"title": "Liquidity Risk",
					"description": "Even a thriving export business can face liquidity crises from one bad deal, leading to cash shortages or bankruptcy. This risk is not limited to new clients—existing partners can default due to their own troubles, amplifying payment risks. A single large unpaid invoice can create a domino effect, affecting the ability to pay suppliers, meet payroll, and fulfill other orders. This liquidity risk is particularly acute for smaller exporters who may not have sufficient cash reserves to weather payment defaults."
				},
				"paymentDelays": {
					"title": "Payment Delays",
					"description": "Payment delays plague exporters from two main sources: importers who pay late due to cash flow issues, and traditional payment methods that can take weeks to clear through banking systems. These delays disrupt cash flow, increase holding costs, and strain operations. Exporters often find themselves in difficult positions where they need to pay suppliers and employees while waiting for delayed payments from international buyers, creating a cascade of financial stress throughout their business operations."
				},
				"highFees": {
					"title": "High Fees",
					"description": "Traditional international payment systems typically involve correspondent banking relationships, currency conversion fees, wire transfer charges, and intermediary bank fees, all of which compound to create substantial costs that directly impact the profitability of export transactions. These expenses can erode profit margins, especially in competitive markets."
				},
				"trustIssues": {
					"title": "Trust Issues and Missing Growth Opportunities",
					"description": "Building trust with new or unfamiliar trading partners is difficult, especially across borders where cultural, legal, and language barriers exist. Exporters, particularly those with no prior trade history with a partner, struggle to verify reliability without extensive due diligence, which is time-consuming and costly. Without a proven track record, exporters hesitate to engage, missing out on valuable growth opportunities in emerging markets. This often leads to stalled deals and limited expansion into potentially lucrative new territories."
				},
				"letterOfCredit": {
					"title": "Expensive and Cumbersome Traditional Trade Finance",
					"description": "Traditional trade finance instruments like Letters of Credit and bank guarantees are often prohibitively expensive due to multiple intermediaries taking fees at each step. Small and medium-sized exporters frequently lack access to these instruments or find that the costs would completely eliminate their profit margins, making deals unprofitable. Banks require extensive documentation, collateral, and credit facilities that many growing export businesses cannot provide. The complexity and expense of these traditional instruments often force exporters to either accept higher risks or abandon potentially profitable international opportunities."
				},
				"disputeResolution": {
					"title": "Dispute Resolution Challenges",
					"description": "Disputes over quality, delivery, or payment are hard to resolve internationally due to differing legal systems and high costs of arbitration. Exporters may spend significant time and resources on cross-border conflicts with uncertain outcomes. Moreover, these disputes can damage relationships and reputations in international markets. The complexity of navigating different legal frameworks, languages, and business practices makes dispute resolution a lengthy and expensive process that many exporters simply cannot afford to pursue."

					"quote": "I needed specialized machinery for my manufacturing plant and found a supplier offering exactly what I needed at a fair price. They seemed legitimate—professional website, good communication, I even met them in person at a fair. I paid €450,000 upfront as requested. Weeks passed, then months. No delivery, no response to my calls. It was a complete scam. I had to shut down production and search for new suppliers, which took months. The delayed production cost me three major contracts, and the cash flow crisis nearly destroyed my business. I learned the hard way that even legitimate-looking suppliers can disappear with your money."

					"quote": "We had been working with a textile supplier for over three years who always requested payment in advance. At the beginning, we felt uncomfortable, but after a couple of successful transactions, we trusted them. The quality was always good, nothing to dispute. We ordered as always a large quantity for preparing the summer collection, but our supplier went bankrupt in between. We had paid €280,000 in advance, but only recovered a small amount through the bankruptcy process after paying expensive legal fees. I still ask myself if it was our mistake to pay in advance, but if your supplier is the only one to provide this special textile, what should you do? Close your business or accept the terms?"

					"title": "Prepayment and Non-Delivery Risk",
					"description": "Importers face significant risks when paying suppliers upfront, as fraudulent suppliers may disappear after receiving payment without delivering goods. This is particularly common with new suppliers or those found through online marketplaces. Even legitimate suppliers can fail to deliver due to production issues, financial difficulties, or other unforeseen circumstances, leaving importers without recourse and facing operational disruptions."
				},
				"qualityIssues": {
					"title": "Quality Issues and Disputes",
					"description": "Importers risk receiving goods that don't meet specifications, like incorrect quantities or poor quality. Verifying compliance across borders is tough and costly, leaving importers with unusable inventory that hurts their business. When disputes arise over defective or incorrect goods, they are hard to resolve internationally due to differing laws and languages. Lengthy conflicts drain time and money, damaging supplier relationships and creating additional operational challenges."
				},
				"delayedPayments": {
					"title": "Delayed Payments and Delivery",
					"description": "Banking payment delays create problems for importers and exporters. When importers need urgent supplies, slow international money transfers mean exporters won't start production or shipping until money arrives, causing critical delays. Similarly, when payment after delivery takes too long due to banking systems, it hurts payment deadlines for exporters and damages the importer's reputation for future deals. Additionally, exporters may delay shipments to non-prepaying importers, causing stock shortages or missed sales that disrupt supply chains, especially for time-sensitive businesses."
				},
				"restrictedSuppliers": {
					"title": "Restricted Supplier Options",
					"description": "Exporters may refuse to ship without prepayment, restricting importers' access to diverse suppliers. This limits opportunities to source from new or cost-effective markets and reduces competitive pricing options."

				"pressureToPay": {

					"description": "Exporters may push for quick payment post-delivery, before thorough quality checks. Paying too soon risks losses if defects are found later, with little recourse across borders."
				},
				"highFees": {
					"title": "High Fees",
					"description": "Traditional international payment systems involve multiple intermediaries, each adding fees for currency conversion, wire transfers, and processing. These costs accumulate quickly through correspondent banking relationships and intermediary charges, significantly impacting profit margins and ultimately increasing the total cost of goods purchased, especially for smaller import businesses or high-volume, low-margin transactions."
				},
				"supplierReliability": {
					"title": "Supplier Reliability and Due Diligence",
					"description": "Verifying supplier credibility, financial stability, and production capabilities across different countries and business cultures is challenging and time-consuming.

				"gettingStarted": {
					"title": "Getting Started",
					"questions": {
						"whatIsEscrow": {
							"question": "What is digital escrow for international trade?",
							"answer": "Digital escrow for international trade is a secure peer-to-peer payment system that protects both exporters and importers during transactions. Instead of a third party holding your funds, the system uses smart contracts on the blockchain to automatically manage payments based on pre-agreed conditions. Funds remain in the smart contract (Escrow) until delivery and verification conditions are met, eliminating the traditional risks where either the exporter ships first without payment guarantee or the importer pays upfront without delivery assurance."
						},
						"howToGetStarted": {
							"question": "How do I get started with trade escrow?",
							"answer": "Click the \"Start Escrow\" button on the top right corner to create a wallet or sign-in. For more detailed information about the complete process, see our Workflow page which explains each step from setup to fund release."
						},
						"tradeTypes": {
							"question": "What types of trades can use escrow?",
							"answer": "Digital escrow can be used in nearly every industry where goods are delivered, including manufacturing, electronics, textiles, machinery, agricultural products, raw materials, and more. The escrow supports B2B (business-to-business), B2C (business-to-consumer), and C2C (consumer-to-consumer) transactions. For a comprehensive overview of supported industries, visit our Supporting All Trade Industries section to get a first impression of the possibilities."
						}
					}
				},
				"securitySafety": {
					"title": "Security & Safety",
					"questions": {
						"fundSecurity": {
							"question": "How secure are my funds in escrow?",
							"answer": "Funds in the escrow are very secure. No third party, including the development company that created the technology behind the escrow, has access to funds in the escrow. The funds are held in what's called a smart contract, which is a self-executing program on the blockchain that automatically enforces the agreed terms without human intervention. The escrow uses a multi-signature approach, meaning multiple cryptographic signatures are required to authorize any transaction, providing an additional layer of security. This ensures that funds can only be released when all predetermined conditions are met by both trading parties."
						},
						"disputeResolution": {
							"question": "What happens if there's a dispute?",
							"answer": "Both parties can raise disputes, which immediately freezes the funds to protect everyone involved. Once a dispute is initiated, both parties have time to find a bilateral compromise and agree on adjustments such as offering discounts or extending delivery deadlines. If they cannot reach a compromise through direct negotiation, the case will be escalated to a neutral arbitrator for final resolution. For detailed information about this process, see our Dispute Resolution Process section."
						}
					}
				},
				"processTimeline": {
					"title": "Process & Timeline",
					"questions": {
						"processDuration": {
							"question": "How long does the escrow process take?",
							"answer": "The time depends entirely on your business and the nature of the goods being traded. It could be just a couple of days for simple transactions, but also months or even years for complex manufacturing projects. Here's a typical example: Setup (1-2 days), Funding (5 days), Production (20 weeks), Shipping (4 weeks), Inspection (2 days), Funds release (same day). For a quicker transaction: Setup and Funding today, Delivery in 3 days, Inspection and funds release on the day of arrival."
						},
						"fundRelease": {
							"question": "When are funds released to the exporter?",
							"answer": "Fund release depends on the pre-agreed release methods that both parties establish when setting up the escrow. The release method depends on the specific needs and requirements of your transaction. For detailed information about the various release options available, see our Flexible Release Mechanisms section."
						}
					}
				},
				"paymentsFees": {
					"title": "Payments & Fees",
					"questions": {
						"fees": {
							"question": "What are the fees for using trade escrow?",
							"answer": "The escrow is based on a blockchain solution, which requires transaction fees (often called \"gas fees\" - named after the computational energy needed to process transactions, similar to how a car needs gas to run). These blockchain transaction fees are necessary to secure and process your transactions on the network. There may be additional fees such as inspection fees for external verification, fees for trade advisors, and fees for arbitration services. All fees are completely transparent - when you define the principal amount and select optional services during escrow setup, both exporter and importer will see exactly what fees apply. The importer funds the principal amount plus all fees, and the escrow will not be activated unless the full amount is funded."
						},
						"paymentMethods": {
							"question": "What payment methods are accepted?",
							"answer": "You need to distinguish between payment methods for the escrow and payment methods for your wallet. The escrow uses only digital currencies such as USDT (USD from Tether), USDC (USD from Circle), or other stablecoins and CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). The escrow is funded using currencies from your digital wallet. To get USDC, USDT, or other stablecoins into your wallet, you can use cryptocurrency exchanges or On-Ramp providers. For detailed information about converting traditional money to digital currencies, see our How can I change FIAT into Stablecoins? section."
						}
					}
				},
				"internationalTrade": {
					"title": "International Trade",
					"questions": {
						"supportedCountries": {
							"question": "Which countries and regions are supported?",
							"answer": "The escrow is a peer-to-peer system that can theoretically connect exporters and importers in any country or region of the world. However, it can only be used in countries where digital currencies are legally allowed. Some restrictions may apply based on local regulations and international sanctions lists. We recommend checking your local regulations regarding digital currency usage and checking international regulations and sanctions before proceeding with transactions."
						},
						"customsRegulations": {
							"question": "How do you handle customs and import/export regulations?",
							"answer": "The escrow is a financial contract that is based on the underlying buying contract or commercial invoice but does not replace these contracts. Exporters and importers are responsible for handling customs procedures, import/export licenses, trade documentation, compliance with international trade regulations, product certifications, and all other regulatory requirements. Since the escrow operates as a peer-to-peer transaction, OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) compliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) responsibilities remain with the individual trading partners. We recommend consulting with trade professionals and legal advisors for complex international transactions."
